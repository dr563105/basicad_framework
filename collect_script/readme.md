### Sensors and their placement
The colour RGB camera sensors face front, left, and right of the car and are place of the
top of it. The left and right sensor are angled at an angle of 20 degrees to the ground.
The depth grayscale camera is similarly placed along side the RGB camera.
The segmented camera sensor faces the front. 
A radar sensor is placed in the front of the car facing front. It projects a beam that
detects when other vehicles are near and also provides the distance between them.
